7. Longer LED Strip Runs, Please Power From 2 pin Power Wire of Both Ends To Reduce Voltage Drop.
How to Choose LED Power Supply and Pixels Controller?
First, Calculated The Whole Led Strip Lights Watts.
One Led Chip is About 0.3W, If You Buy 5m 60Leds/m ( Total LED Strip is 300 Leds ), So 0.3W*300=90W.
Then, Choose the Right Led Power Supply.
This Led Strip is Work with DC5V Power, So 90W / 5V=18A ( At Least 18A or more ).
Finally, Choose the Right Pixels Controller You Like.
WS2812B Led Strip is Controlled By Single Data Line Controller.
So you could choose them from our store, we have IR/RF Remote, Bluetooth, Wifi, Music APP and Computer controller etc. ( If you can't recognize them, you could feel free to contact us, we will glad to help you )
